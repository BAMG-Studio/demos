# Module 06 — CNAPP & CSPM (Wiz / Orca / Prisma Cloud)

## Objective
Understand posture management vs runtime protection; define evaluation criteria and integration points.

## Notes
- Agentless for fast coverage; selective agents for runtime blocking.
- Prioritize toxic combinations (exposed + vulnerable + privileged).

## Deliverables
- Tool comparison matrix; sample policies; integration plan to CI/CD and ticketing.
