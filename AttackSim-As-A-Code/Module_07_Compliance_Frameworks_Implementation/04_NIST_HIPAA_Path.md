# 04 - NIST & HIPAA Path

- NIST CSF/800-53: map to logging, IAM, encryption, backups, IR.
- HIPAA: PHI data classification, access logs, encryption, audit retention.
- Use Security Hub standards where available; supplement with Config custom rules.

Outcome: Tailored roadmap for regulated workloads.
