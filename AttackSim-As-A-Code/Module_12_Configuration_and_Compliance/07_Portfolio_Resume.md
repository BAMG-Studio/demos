- Built org-wide AWS Config aggregation with conformance packs (CIS/NIST) and auto-remediation (SSM Automation) for public S3, open SGs, and CloudTrail tampering.
- Delivered evidence-ready compliance pipeline: weekly Security Hub exports, Config advanced queries, and Object-Locked evidence bucket for audits.
- Implemented drift guardrails with SCPs + Config/Lambda to prevent/auto-revert logging and firewall changes; improved compliance posture scores by X%.
