- Codified purple-team scenarios (Stratus + custom) with CI/CD scheduler, auto cleanup, and S3 evidence store; mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.
- Built scoring/reporting (MTTD/MTTR, coverage) and gates to fail builds on missing detections.
- Drove detection/playbook backlog from simulation outcomes with assigned owners.

Artifacts: scenario catalog, pipeline YAML, sample run report, Slack alert screenshot.
