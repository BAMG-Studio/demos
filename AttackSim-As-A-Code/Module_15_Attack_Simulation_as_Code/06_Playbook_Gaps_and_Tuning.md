# 06 - Playbook Gaps & Tuning

For each failed/partial detection:
- Identify missing signal/rule.
- Add EventBridge/OpenSearch monitor or Lambda playbook (see Module 16).
- Track as issue with owner and due date.

Outcome: Continuous improvement loop from simulation → detection/response tuning.
