# 01 - Planning & Safety

- Always use sandbox account; tag all resources `Purpose=AttackSim`.
- Pre-create IAM role for simulations with least-priv per scenario.
- Budget alarms for unexpected spend.
- Clean-up scripts mandatory; run with `stratus cleanup` and verify no leftovers.

Outcome: Safe, governed simulation environment.
