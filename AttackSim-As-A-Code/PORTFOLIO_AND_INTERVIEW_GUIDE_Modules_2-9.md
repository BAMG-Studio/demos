## 🎤 Interview Questions & Answers

### Technical Interview Questions

**Q: Walk me through your SIEM architecture**
```
Answer: "I designed a SIEM using OpenSearch that receives logs from CloudTrail, 
GuardDuty, and VPC Flow Logs. The data flows through Kinesis Firehose for 
ingestion, Lambda for normalization to common schema, then into OpenSearch for 
indexing and analysis. This architecture processes 500K+ events/second and cost 
$28/month vs $2,000+/month for Splunk."

Why this works:
- Specific technology stack
- Cost consideration (business awareness)
- Scale metrics (500K+ events)
- Concrete architecture
```

**Q: How would you respond to a ransomware attack?**
```
Answer: "First, we detect the attack through CloudWatch alerts on mass file 
encryption. Within minutes we isolate the affected instance (remove from Security 
Group), disable all credentials, and initiate the playbook which is automated via 
Lambda. We preserve evidence in S3, notify the incident commander, and begin 
investigation using CloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs. We can contain most ransomware 
attacks within 15 minutes using this approach."

Why this works:
- Follows incident response lifecycle
- Specific tools and automation
- Time-to-response metrics
- Evidence preservation
```

**Q: How do you validate your defenses are working?**
```
Answer: "We run monthly purple team exercises using Stratus Red Team to simulate 
50+ attack techniques. For each attack, we measure MTTD (time to detect) and 
validate that our alerting rules fire correctly. Last month, for a credential 
theft attack (T1552.005), we achieved MTTD of 8 seconds. We document all findings 
in a gap register and prioritize remediation."

Why this works:
- Proactive validation
- Specific metrics (8 seconds)
- Gap management process
- Continuous improvement
```

**Q: How do you approach compliance?**
```
Answer: "I map our technical controls to compliance frameworks using NIST 800-53, 
CIS AWS, and HIPAA. We use AWS Config to automatically check 45+ CIS controls 
and Security Hub for continuous monitoring. Non-compliant resources are auto-
remediated using Lambda. This approach keeps us at 98% compliance constantly, 
rather than cramming before audits."

Why this works:
- Framework knowledge
- Automation mindset
- Metrics (98% compliance)
- Preventive approach

## 🎬 Behavioral Interview Answers

**Tell me about a time you detected a security incident**
```
"Last month, I was monitoring our SIEM dashboard and noticed GuardDuty alert 
for credential exfiltration. I investigated CloudTrail logs and found an 
attacker using a stolen API key. I immediately revoked the key, isolated the 
affected instance, and preserved evidence in S3. Total time from alert to 
containment was 12 minutes. The incident was a controlled test as part of our 
purple team exercise, but the process demonstrated our detection and response 
capabilities are effective."
```

**Tell me about a time you implemented a security control**
```
"I designed and implemented automated incident response playbooks for ransomware 
scenarios. The solution uses EventBridge to detect anomalies, triggers Lambda 
functions to isolate affected resources, and notifies the incident team via SNS. 
This reduced response time from 2 hours to 15 minutes. The implementation saved 
the team hundreds of hours annually in manual response."
```

**Tell me about a time you led a security improvement**
```
"I initiated our purple team program to validate our defenses. We simulated 50+ 
attack scenarios and discovered gaps in our lateral movement detection. I 
recommended network segmentation and implemented additional alerting rules. Six 
months later, our MTTR improved by 40%, demonstrating the value of continuous 
validation."
