# 03 - Event Types & Patterns

Patterns to codify:
- GuardDuty severity >=7
- Root ConsoleLogin
- StopLogging/DeleteTrail
- IAM CreateUser/CreateAccessKey (non-CI roles)
- SG 0.0.0.0/0 on 22/3389
- S3 PutBucketAcl public

Include JSON event patterns for EventBridge.

Outcome: Ready-to-use patterns for routing.
