# 03 - Technical Drills

Hands-on drills in sandbox:
- GuardDuty sample → Lambda playbook fires (EC2 isolate)
- Config violation (public S3) → auto-remediation
- IAM key compromise simulation → disable + deny

Record timestamps (T0 attack, T1 detect, T2 contain) for MTTD/MTTR.

Outcome: Proven runbooks with measured times.
