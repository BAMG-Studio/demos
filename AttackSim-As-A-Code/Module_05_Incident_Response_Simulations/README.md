# Module 5: Incident Response Simulations – Master Guide

## What & Why
Run realistic IR exercises (tabletop + technical) to validate plans, tooling, and people. Focus on AWS scenarios and evidence capture.

## Path
1) `01_High_Impact_Incident_Scenarios.md` (existing)
2) `02_Tabletop_Scenarios.md`
3) `03_Technical_Drills.md`
4) `04_Roles_and_Communications.md`
5) `05_Forensics_Checklists.md`
6) `06_Metrics_and_After_Action.md`
7) `07_Portfolio_Resume.md`

## Success Criteria
- Two tabletop scenarios with comms plan and decision log
- Two hands-on drills executed with evidence captured
- After-action reports with findings, owners, and dates

Cost: minimal (mostly time; small Lambda/SNS during drills).
