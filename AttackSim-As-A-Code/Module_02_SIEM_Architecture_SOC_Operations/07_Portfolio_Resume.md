- Designed AWS-first SIEM architecture with normalized pipelines (CloudTrail, VPC Flow, DNS, WAF, GuardDuty) into OpenSearch hot + S3 cold tiers.
- Built SOC dashboards and alerts tied to runbooks (root login, CloudTrail tamper, IAM backdoor, SG open) with severity routing.
- Produced cost/retention plan with ILM and sampling to keep ingest under budget.

Artifacts: architecture diagram, field mapping table, dashboard screenshots, alert+runbook links.
