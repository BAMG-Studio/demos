# 05 - Testing, Drills, SLOs

## Tests
- GuardDuty sample findings trigger playbooks weekly.
- Config violation tests monthly (public S3, open SG) with auto-remediation.

## SLOs
- Detection to alert < 2 min; alert to containment < 1 min for auto-playbooks.
- Track success/failure via CloudWatch metrics and dashboards.

## Drills
- Quarterly game days with Stratus scenarios (Module 15) and measure MTTD/MTTR.

Outcome: Measured, reliable automation with continuous validation.
