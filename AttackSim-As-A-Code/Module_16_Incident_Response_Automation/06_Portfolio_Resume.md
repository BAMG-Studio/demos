- Automated IR playbooks (EC2 isolate, IAM key disable, S3 public fix, SG revert) via EventBridge+Lambda/SSM with DLQs and retries; sub-60s containment.
- Built evidence pipeline (snapshots, logs, manifests) to Object-Locked S3; alerts to Slack/SNS with ticket links.
- Established SLOs and recurring drills using GuardDuty samples and Stratus scenarios to prove MTTR/MTTD improvements.

Artifacts: Lambda code snippets, EventBridge patterns, SSM doc screenshots, drill metrics dashboard.
