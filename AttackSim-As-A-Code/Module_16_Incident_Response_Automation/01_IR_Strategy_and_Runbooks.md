# 01 - IR Strategy & Runbooks

## Model
- Map to NIST: Prep → Detect/Analyze → Contain → Eradicate → Recover → Lessons.
- Classify incidents: Unauthorized access, malware/crypto, data exposure, config tamper.

## Runbook Templates
- Inputs: trigger, required context, severity, SLA, actions, owners.
- Outputs: evidence locations, notifications, ticket links.

Outcome: Standardized runbooks to automate.
