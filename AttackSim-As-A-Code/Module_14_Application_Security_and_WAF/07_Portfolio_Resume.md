# Portfolio / Resume Bullets (Module 14)

- Deployed AWS WAF on CloudFront/API GW with managed + custom rules, rate limits, and geo/IP controls; enabled logging to OpenSearch with alerting on spikes.
- Secured APIs with OIDC auth, request validation, throttling, and per-stage usage plans; enforced HTTPS/HSTS at the edge.
- Built CI/CD security gates (SAST, dependency + secrets scanning, IaC checks) with signed artifacts and SBOMs.

Artifacts: WAF ACL screenshot, blocked-request dashboard, pipeline policy snippet, API test results (401/429/block).
