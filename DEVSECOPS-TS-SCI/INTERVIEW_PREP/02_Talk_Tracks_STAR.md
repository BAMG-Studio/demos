# STAR talk tracks (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

## How to answer fast
- **Situation**: what was happening
- **Task**: what you owned
- **Action**: what you did (tools + decisions)
- **Result**: measurable outcome + what you learned

## Templates you will reuse

- Task:
- Action: standardized pipeline template, security gates, artifact versioning, approvals
- Result: faster delivery with fewer production issues; improved auditability

### Incident / failure recovery
- Situation:
- Task:
- Action: rollback, root cause analysis, added guardrail in pipeline/IaC
- Result: reduced recurrence; improved monitoring/runbook
