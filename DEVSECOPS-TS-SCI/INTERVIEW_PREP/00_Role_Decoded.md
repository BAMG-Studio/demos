# Role decoded (plain English)

**DevSecOps Engineer** = the person who makes sure software moves from a developer laptop to production safely and repeatably.

In this job, you’re expected to:
- build and maintain automated pipelines (CI/CD — Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery)
- package apps into containers (Docker) and run them on Kubernetes
- define cloud infrastructure using code (IaC — Infrastructure as Code)
- treat security as a built-in quality gate (not a last-minute review)
- produce documentation that operators and auditors can follow

## What to emphasize for a TS/SCI environment
- repeatability over heroics (no “hand-crafted” servers)
- strong change control, logging, and audit trails
- least privilege access (only the minimum permissions needed)
- predictable, documented procedures (runbooks)
