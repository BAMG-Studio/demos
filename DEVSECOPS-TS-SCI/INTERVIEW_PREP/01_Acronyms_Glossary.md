# Acronyms glossary (expanded + plain English)

This glossary expands acronyms the way you should in an interview: say the full term once, then use the acronym.

## Core DevSecOps
- **Agile**: a delivery approach where work is split into small increments with frequent feedback.
- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: every code change is automatically built and tested.
- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)**: successful changes are automatically prepared (and sometimes deployed) to environments.
- **DevSecOps**: Development + Security + Operations working as one system, with security checks automated in the delivery pipeline.

## Security testing
- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)**: scans source code for risky patterns (security spell-check).
- **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**: tests a running app like an attacker would.
- **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)**: checks third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities.
- **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)**: a list of what components are inside your software artifact.

## Containers and Kubernetes
- **Docker**: toolchain for building and running container images.
- **Container image**: a packaged “box” containing app code + dependencies.
- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: system that runs and manages many containers reliably.
- **Helm**: package manager for Kubernetes deployments.

## Infrastructure and cloud
- **IaC (Infrastructure as Code)**: cloud resources defined in version-controlled files.
- **CaC (Configuration as Code)**: server/app configuration defined in version-controlled files.
- **Terraform**: IaC tool for provisioning cloud infrastructure.
- **Ansible**: automation tool for configuring servers and running repeatable tasks.
- **Packer**: tool to build standardized machine images (“golden images”).

## Cloud basics (AWS)
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: a private network inside AWS.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: who can do what.
- **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: managed Kubernetes on AWS.

## Clearance
- **TS/SCI (Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information)**: a clearance context where auditability, least privilege, and strict procedures matter.
