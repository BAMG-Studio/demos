# TS/SCI operating model (what interviewers care about)

## Plain-English expectations
- You don’t “wing it” in production.
- You can explain what changed, why it changed, and how to roll back.
- You treat logs and evidence as first-class outputs.

## Behaviors to highlight
- checklists and runbooks
- peer review and approvals
- minimal access and short-lived credentials
- separation of environments (dev/test/prod)

## What to avoid
- oversharing details you don’t need to share
- undocumented manual changes
