# 30 / 60 / 90 day plan (DevSecOps Engineer)

## First 30 days (learn + stabilize)
- learn the org’s delivery process, compliance constraints, and environments
- map the current pipelines and identify inconsistent gates
- document “how deployments work” and “how rollbacks work”

## Days 31–60 (standardize)
- introduce a reusable pipeline template/shared library
- baseline security gates (SAST/SCA/image scan/IaC scan)
- improve artifact versioning, tagging, and traceability

## Days 61–90 (scale + harden)
- expand templates across many apps
- add policy-as-code guardrails
- improve observability and incident automation
- tighten least-privilege pipeline permissions
