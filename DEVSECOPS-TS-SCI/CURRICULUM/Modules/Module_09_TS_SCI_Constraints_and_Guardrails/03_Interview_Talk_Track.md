# Interview talk track — TS/SCI constraints and guardrails

## 30 seconds
"In constrained environments I focus on repeatability and evidence. We standardize pipelines, restrict privilege, and control artifacts so every deploy is traceable and reversible. The goal is delivery with guardrails, not delivery by exception."

## 60 seconds
Add:
- deterministic builds and provenance
- controlled egress and approved artifact sources
- separation of duties and approvals

## 120 seconds
Add:
- how to keep teams productive (templates, self-service, clear runbooks)
- what evidence is produced automatically
- incident response posture and rollback-first operations
