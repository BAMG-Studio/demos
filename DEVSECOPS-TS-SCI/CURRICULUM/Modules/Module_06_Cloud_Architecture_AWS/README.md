# Module 06 — Cloud Architecture (AWS)

## Outcome
You can explain (in plain English) how an AWS environment is structured for enterprise: networking, identity, logging, and multi-account guardrails.

## Deliverables (what you will produce)
- `Developer_Journal.md`
- `Implementation_Summary.md`
- `03_Interview_Talk_Track.md`

## Files
- `01_Concepts.md`
- `02_HandsOn.md`
- `03_Interview_Talk_Track.md`
- `Developer_Journal.md`
- `Implementation_Summary.md`

## Prereqs
- None required to read `01_Concepts.md`
- Optional for hands-on: `aws` CLI configured (or treat as a design lab)

## How to run (quick start)

```bash
cd /home/papaert/projects/lab/DEVSECOPS-TS-SCI
./scripts/ci_local.sh
```
