# Concepts (plain English)

## What DevSecOps is (and is not)
**DevSecOps** means Development + Security + Operations behave like one system.

- Development writes features.
- Operations keeps systems running.
- Security makes sure systems cannot be easily abused.

DevSecOps is not “security added at the end.” It is security built into the same automation that already builds and deploys software.

## The assembly-line model
- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: every change is automatically built and tested.
- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)**: passing changes are automatically prepared for release and deployed with guardrails.

Plain English: every change goes through the same automated assembly line so humans don’t rely on memory, luck, or tribal knowledge.

## Why this matters (mapped to the job description)
This role explicitly needs:
- pipelines for hundreds of apps
- containerized applications
- Kubernetes + Helm
- IaC/CaC with Terraform/Ansible/Packer
- Linux scripting
- documentation that auditors/operators can follow

DevSecOps ties these together by enforcing consistency.
