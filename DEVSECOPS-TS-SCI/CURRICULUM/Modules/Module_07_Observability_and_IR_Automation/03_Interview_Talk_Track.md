## 60 seconds
Add:
- logs/metrics/traces as complementary tools
- reduce alert fatigue by tuning and SLOs
- evidence generation and tamper-evident logging

## 120 seconds
Add:
- how to scale observability patterns across hundreds of apps
- least-privilege automation identities
- safe automation: approvals for disruptive actions and rollback-first mindset
