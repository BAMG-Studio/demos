# Module 07 — Observability and IR Automation

## Outcome
You can explain logs/metrics/traces in plain English, define what “good telemetry” looks like, and describe a practical incident response automation approach.

## Deliverables (what you will produce)
- `Developer_Journal.md`
- `Implementation_Summary.md`
- `03_Interview_Talk_Track.md`

## Files
- `01_Concepts.md`
- `02_HandsOn.md`
- `03_Interview_Talk_Track.md`
- `Developer_Journal.md`
- `Implementation_Summary.md`

## Prereqs
- None required to read `01_Concepts.md`
- Optional for hands-on: `docker` (to view service logs)

## How to run (quick start)

```bash
cd /home/papaert/projects/lab/DEVSECOPS-TS-SCI
./scripts/demo_service.sh docker
```
