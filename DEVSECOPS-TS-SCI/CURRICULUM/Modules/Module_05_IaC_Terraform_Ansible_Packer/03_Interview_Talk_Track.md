# Interview talk track — IaC/CaC/Packer

## 30 seconds
"I treat environments as versioned code. Terraform defines the infrastructure, Ansible applies consistent configuration, and Packer produces hardened golden images. The result is repeatable builds, faster recovery, and a clean audit trail."

## 60 seconds
Add:
- state management and change review
- drift detection and prevention
- policy gates (what must never reach prod)

## 120 seconds
Add:
- multi-environment/multi-account strategy
- how to handle secrets and least privilege
- how you produce evidence (plans, approvals, reports) and execute rollback
