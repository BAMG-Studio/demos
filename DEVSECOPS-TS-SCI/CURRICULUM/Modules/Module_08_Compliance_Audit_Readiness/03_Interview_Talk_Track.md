# Interview talk track — Compliance and audit readiness

## 30 seconds
"I treat compliance as continuous evidence. Pipelines run the same tests and security gates on every change, and the outputs become audit artifacts. That reduces manual effort and makes audits predictable."

## 60 seconds
Add:
- mapping evidence to controls
- least privilege and separation of duties
- retention and access controls for logs/artifacts

## 120 seconds
Add:
- risk register and compensating controls
- how you harden the pipeline itself (trusted runners, locked-down secrets)
- how you respond to findings and demonstrate closure
