# DEVSECOPS-TS-SCI — Enterprise DevSecOps Interview Prep + Live Demos

This folder is a purpose-built, enterprise-grade curriculum and demo portfolio tailored to a DevSecOps Engineer role supporting large, security-sensitive environments (TS/SCI).

## Quick start (local)

```bash
cd /home/papaert/projects/lab/DEVSECOPS-TS-SCI
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Run the containerized demo service
./scripts/demo_service.sh

# Run the CI-style checks locally (tests + linters + basic security)
./scripts/ci_local.sh
```

## What’s inside

- `00_START_HERE_Quick_Reference.md` — fastest path to results + command crib sheet
- `COURSE_STRUCTURE_AND_ROADMAP.md` — how to work the curriculum like a real job
- `MASTER_INDEX.md` — links to every module/demo
- `INTERVIEW_PREP/` — talk tracks, acronyms, Q&A, TS/SCI operating model
- `CURRICULUM/Modules/` — structured modules (concepts → hands-on → interview mapping)
- `DEMOS/` — live, runnable projects with implementation summaries and runbooks
- `templates/` — reusable templates for journals, runbooks, and implementation summaries

## Guiding principle

Everything here is written in plain English, expands acronyms on first use, and ties each artifact to job requirements: pipelines at scale, containers, Kubernetes, cloud architecture, IaC (Infrastructure as Code), Linux + scripting, security automation, and documentation.
